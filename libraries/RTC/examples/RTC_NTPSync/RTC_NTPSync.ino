/**
 * This example shows how to set the RTC (Real Time Clock) on the Portenta C33 
 * to the current date and time retrieved from an NTP server on the Internet (pool.ntp.org).
 * Then the current time from the RTC is printed to the Serial port.
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Change the WiFi credentials in the arduino_secrets.h file to match your WiFi network.
 * 2. Upload this sketch to Portenta C33.
 * 3. Open the Serial Monitor.
